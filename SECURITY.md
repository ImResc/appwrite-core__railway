# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We value security for the project very highly. 
If you find a security vulnerability in the Appwrite project, kindly email us at <a href="mailto:security@appwrite.io">security@appwrite.io</a> instead of posting a public issue in GitHub.

At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly
so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
