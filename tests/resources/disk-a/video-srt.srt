00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:18,616
Good evening, have a good week.

2
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:21,130
Happy birthday to the ILF,
Israeli Leadership Forum.

3
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:24,192
Today we have 500 members,

4
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:28,495
a powerful community bringing
leaders together

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,253
out of a true desire to create change.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,999
Thank you very much, dear members
of the ILF. I'm glad to be a part of ILF.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,713
There is an inconceivable power here,
a power of people.

8
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:42,240
A much larger power
than we each have as individuals.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,701
And it's really exciting to see
that the values

10
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:49,165
are the guiding light for everyone
sitting in this room,

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,980
in order to change the world.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,575
We sit looking at a new immigrant
who just came here three years ago,

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,120
making change, dramatic change.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,792
He represents the Israel
we don't see on the news.

15
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,017
The normal Israel.

16
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:09,003
Man of the Year in Israel,
Silvan Adams.

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,978
So believe it or not,

18
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:21,965
because they suspect us,
I'd say,

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,395
because of the news reports from over here,

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,870
we need always show
the best face of Israel.
