## 4. Hacktoberfest Contribution Guidelines

To participate in Hacktoberfest with Appwrite, follow these guidelines:

### 4.1 Valid Issues

To make your contribution count, please look for issues labeled with `hacktoberfest`. Only issues labeled with `hacktoberfest` will count as a valid contribution.

### 4.2 Wait for Issue Assignment

After you have identified an issue to work on, please wait for it to be assigned to you by our team. We assign issues on a first-come, first-serve basis.

### 4.3 Knowing About Labels

We do not have the `hacktoberfest` label in our repositories, but we use it on specific issues. For your pull request to be valid, our team will review and add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label once it meets the criteria.

### 4.4 Discuss New Issues

If you're interested in finding and adding new issues for Hacktoberfest, please discuss it with the team on our [Discord server](https://appwrite.io/discord) in the `#hacktoberfest` channel.

### 4.5 Be Patient with Pull Request Reviews

PR reviews may take up to 15 days due to the volume of contributions. However, we also host PR review parties every week where you can add your PRs for instant review.

### 4.6 Regular Updates

If you've been assigned an issue, it's essential to share updates every 3 days. Failure to do so may result in being unassigned from the issue.
