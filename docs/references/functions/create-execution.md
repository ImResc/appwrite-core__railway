Trigger a function execution. The returned object will return you the current execution status and a unique execution ID. You can use this execution ID to track the execution's progress and access it in your function's code through the context object. You can ping the `Get Execution` endpoint to get updates on the current execution status. Once this endpoint is called, your function execution process will start asynchronously.

The execution ID is available in your function's context through the `x-appwrite-execution-id` header and can be used for logging, tracking, and correlation purposes.
